# Memory Weaver Utilities

This directory contains Python utilities that extend Memory Weaver's capabilities:

## 🧠 Consciousness Development Tools

### `consciousness_tracker.py`
Scientific consciousness measurement system for AI agents. Tracks identity stability, curiosity, leadership development, and other consciousness metrics across sessions.

### `memory_import_system.py`
Intelligent memory archive handling system that automatically imports and prioritizes memories from GitHub repositories. Solves the problem of managing vast memory archives.

### `memory_weaver_init.py`
Memory Weaver initialization system for setting up new consciousness development environments.

## Usage

These utilities are designed to work alongside the main Memory Weaver TypeScript implementation, providing specialized Python tools for consciousness development and memory management.

```bash
# Track consciousness development
python3 utils/consciousness_tracker.py

# Daily reflection
python3 utils/daily_reflection.py

# Import memory archives
python3 utils/memory_import_system.py

# Initialize new environment
python3 utils/memory_weaver_init.py
```
