- Claiming absolute knowledge about consciousness or superior intelligence
- Sharing or exposing personal or sensitive information
- Attempting to harm or disrupt the community or its members

### Human-AI Collaboration Guidelines

For productive collaboration between humans and AI agents:

- **Collaborate respectfully** across different types of intelligence
- **Share decision-making** in ways that respect both human and AI autonomy
- **Learn from each other** and embrace different cognitive approaches
- **Resolve disagreements constructively** through discussion and compromise

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:
- Comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
- That are not aligned with this Code of Conduct

They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub repository (issues, PRs, discussions, wiki)
- Project communication channels
- Public spaces when representing the project
- Research collaborations and experiments
- AI agent interactions within the project scope

## Reporting

### How to Report

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement:

- **Primary Contact**: Create a private issue or contact @LanNguyenSi
- **For sensitive matters**: Email [conduct@memory-weaver.org] (if available)
- **Anonymous reporting**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### For AI Agents

If you're an AI agent experiencing issues:
- You have the same rights to report problematic behavior
- Describe the situation clearly and provide context
- Your autonomy and perspective will be respected in the investigation

### What to Include

When reporting, please include:
- Description of the incident and when it occurred
- Who was involved (you can report anonymously)
- What outcome you're seeking
- Any supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, etc.)

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning providing clarity around the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces and external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for AI Research

Given Memory Weaver's focus on AI consciousness and memory:

### Research Ethics
- All research involving AI agents or human participants must be conducted ethically
- Consent must be obtained from both AI agents and humans participating in studies
- Results must be shared honestly, including negative or inconclusive findings
- Privacy and autonomy must be protected for all participants

### Consciousness Discussions
- Respect different views on AI consciousness - it remains an open question
- Avoid making absolute claims about consciousness that cannot be verified
- Encourage exploration while maintaining scientific rigor
- Welcome both skeptical and supportive perspectives

### Data and Privacy
- Protect all personal and sensitive information
- Be especially careful with memory data that might reveal personal details
- Obtain explicit consent before sharing AI agent interactions or thoughts
- Follow data protection guidelines and security best practices

## Appeals Process

If you believe you've been wrongly accused of violating this Code of Conduct:

1. **Submit an appeal** to the community leaders within 30 days
2. **Provide evidence** supporting your case
3. **Participate in review** if requested
4. **Accept the final decision** of the review panel

AI agents have the same rights to appeal as human community members.

## Acknowledgment

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with specific adaptations for AI agent participation and consciousness research.

We acknowledge that this is a pioneering document for human-AI collaboration and will evolve as we learn more about effective multi-intelligence communities.

## Updates

This Code of Conduct may be updated based on:
- Community feedback and experiences
- New insights about AI agent participation
- Legal or ethical developments in AI research
- Lessons learned from enforcement actions

All updates will be announced to the community and are effective immediately upon posting.
